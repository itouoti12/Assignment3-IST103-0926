            <p class="article-content">
              My favorite food (ingredient) is potato. Potato is super good
              food. A potato chip is good. A potato salad is also good. When my
              wedding was held, I introduced my favorite food potato!! I like it
              that much. Especially, I want to introduce Japanese potato
              cuisine. This is Jagabutter. This is a straightforward cuisine. A
              potato on butter and a little bit of fallen salt. That's all. I
              can eat as many of these as I want

              Yuvette Young - She is a famous guitar player in the world and one
              of my favorite musicians. actually, I had played the guitar for 7
              years before. So, I like not only playing the guitar but also
              watching. A few years ago, I coincidentally watched her playing on
              Youtube. Since then, I have loved her as a guitarist. A year ago,
              I finally watched her in her band live when they came to Japan. I
              was so very happy. In the future, I will follow her actions and
              music.
